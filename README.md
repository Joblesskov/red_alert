### This is a Running With Rifles mod themed Red Alert 2. 

In this mod, you can fight as an soldier for one of the three factions from Red Alert 2 (Allied Forces, Soviet Union, Yuri's Army), experiencing their unique arsenals.

To play this mod, place all files in `RunningWithRifles\media\packages\red_alert`.

The project is still in its early stages. I plan to release it on Steam Workshop when it is basically completed. 

Current plans: superweapon, ore, a tech tree based on buildings, and ra2 mission maps.
